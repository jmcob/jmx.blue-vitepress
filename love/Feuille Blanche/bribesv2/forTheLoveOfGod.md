Jesus,

Trust in you, trust in me, trust in them,

Why would you be that shy,
 why would you hide,
Why would you just leave and close the door behind ?

Instead, you would just stay here, next to us, next to this ouse, listening to me, listening to her cries, drying her terars, doing the most you can, the most, the most you can to relieve this pain inside of us, inside of the one you care and love.

PLEASE CRY,
Again, for the people you love,
you too, as he cries for you everytime you ..
everytime you shut this door he opens back when you don't see.
This is your fresh air.

Please cry instead of this.
